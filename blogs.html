        <p class="text-2xl">1.discus var,let,const?</p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-xl text-red-500">Ans:</span>var can be used in a local variable declaration instead of the
          variable's type. With var , the Java compiler infers the type of the
          variable at compile time, using type information obtained from the
          variable's initializer. The inferred type is then used as the static
          type of the variable..
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans:The let statement is used to declare a local variable in
          TypeScript. It is similar to the var keyword, but it has some
          restriction in scoping in comparison of the var keyword. The let
          keyword can enhance our code readability and decreases the chance of
          programming error.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ans:Const in programming is a keyword that defines a variable or
          pointer as unchangeable. A const may be applied in an object
          declaration to indicate that the object, unlike a standard variable,
          does not change. Such fixed values for objects are often termed
          literals.

        <p class="text-2xl">2.Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?</p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-xl text-red-500">Ans:</span>Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has
          not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. The
          typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. The
          typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose
          value is assigned as null.

        <p class="text-2xl">3.What do you mean by REST API?</p>
        <p>
          <span class="text-xl text-red-500">Ans:</span>An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules
          that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate
          with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
          principles of the REST, or representational state transfer
          architectural style.
